To complete your tasks using the NCDC weather dataset from the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

STEP 1: Download and Prepare the Data
Open your Ubuntu terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Create a directory for the dataset
mkdir -p ~/ncdc/input
cd ~/ncdc/input

# Download the data
wget https://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/raw/master/input/ncdc/all/1901.gz
wget https://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/raw/master/input/ncdc/all/1902.gz
# (Add more years if needed)

# Unzip all files
gunzip *.gz
STEP 2: Set Up a MapReduce Project in Java (Hadoop)
You‚Äôll need Hadoop installed and configured. Assume it's set up in pseudo-distributed mode.

a) Average Temperature per Year
Mapper Code (YearTemperatureMapper.java):

        String line = value.toString();
        String year = line.substring(15, 19);
        int airTemperature;
        try {
            airTemperature = Integer.parseInt(line.substring(87, 92).trim());
            context.write(new Text(year), new IntWritable(airTemperature));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            // Skip invalid records
        }
    }
}
Reducer Code (AverageTemperatureReducer.java):

java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.IOException;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.*;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Reducer;

public class AverageTemperatureReducer extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, DoubleWritable> {
    public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        int sum = 0, count = 0;
        for (IntWritable val : values) {
            sum += val.get();
            count++;
        }
        context.write(key, new DoubleWritable((double) sum / count));
    }
}
b) Mean Max Temperature for Every Month
Mapper Code (MonthMaxTempMapper.java):

java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.IOException;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.*;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper;

public class MonthMaxTempMapper extends Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {

        String line = value.toString();
        String date = line.substring(15, 21); // YYYYMM
        String tempType = line.substring(87, 92).trim();
        int temp;
        try {
            temp = Integer.parseInt(tempType);
            context.write(new Text(date.substring(4, 6)), new IntWritable(temp));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        }
    }

        for (IntWritable val : values) {
            sum += val.get();
            count++;
        }
        context.write(key, new DoubleWritable((double) sum / count));
    }
}
STEP 3: Compile and Package the Program
bash
Copy
Edit
# Create directory
mkdir ~/ncdc/classes

# Compile
javac -classpath $(hadoop classpath) -d ~/ncdc/classes YearTemperatureMapper.java AverageTemperatureReducer.java MonthMaxTempMapper.java MeanMaxTempReducer.java

# Create JAR
jar -cvf ncdc-temp.jar -C ~/ncdc/classes/ .
STEP 4: Run MapReduce Jobs
bash
Copy
Edit
# Upload data to HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir /ncdc
hdfs dfs -put ~/ncdc/input/* /ncdc

# Run Job A: Average Temp Per Year
hadoop jar ncdc-temp.jar YearTemperatureMapper AverageTemperatureReducer /ncdc /output_year_avg

# Run Job B: Mean Max Temp Per Month
hadoop jar ncdc-temp.jar MonthMaxTempMapper MeanMaxTempReducer /ncdc /output_month_avg

# View output
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
hdfs dfs -cat /output_month_avg/part-r-00000
Let me know if you want this done using Python MapReduce with Hadoop Streaming, or Spark for simplicity.
You said:
bash: https://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/raw/master/input/ncdc/all/1902.gz: No such file or directory
ChatGPT said:
It appears that the specific files like 1901.gz or 1902.gz are not available in the GitHub repository at the provided link. Instead, the repository contains a sample file named sample.txt.gz, which you can use for testing and development purposes.
GitHub

‚úÖ Step 1: Download the Sample NCDC Weather Data
To download the sample data file, execute the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal:

bash
Copy

You said:
for step 2 where should i write the java files
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Here's exactly how you should organize your Java files and where to write them during Step 2:

‚úÖ Where to Write the Java Files (Step-by-Step)
üóÇÔ∏è 1. Create a project directory
Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p ~/ncdc/src
cd ~/ncdc/src
üìù 2. Create Java source files inside ~/ncdc/src
You can use any text editor like gedit, nano, or vim. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
gedit YearTemperatureMapper.java
Paste the mapper code for average temperature per year, save and close.

Repeat for the others:

bash
Copy
Edit
gedit AverageTemperatureReducer.java
gedit MonthMaxTempMapper.java
gedit MeanMaxTempReducer.java
Paste the respective Java class code into each.

So now you'll have:

bash
Copy
Edit
~/ncdc/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YearTemperatureMapper.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AverageTemperatureReducer.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MonthMaxTempMapper.java
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MeanMaxTempReducer.java
‚úÖ 3. Compile Java files into classes
Make a directory to store compiled class files:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p ~/ncdc/classes
javac -classpath $(hadoop classpath) -d ~/ncdc/classes *.java
This command compiles all Java files in src/ and puts the .class files into classes/.

üì¶ 4. Create a JAR file
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ncdc
jar -cvf ncdc-temp.jar -C classes/ .
üöÄ 5. Use this JAR file to run your MapReduce job with Hadoop
You‚Äôre now ready to proceed with uploading the data to HDFS and running the job as described earlier.

Would you like help organizing these into a single Eclipse or IntelliJ project, or would you prefer to keep it terminal-based?

You said:
yeartemperaturemapper.java:5: error: class YearTemperatureMapper is public, should be declared in a file named YearTemperatureMapper.java
public class YearTemperatureMapper extends Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
       ^
averagetempreducer.java:5: error: class AverageTemperatureReducer is public, should be declared in a file named AverageTemperatureReducer.java
public class AverageTemperatureReducer extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, DoubleWritable> {

monthmaxtempmapper.java:5: error: class MonthMaxTempMapper is public, should be declared in a file named MonthMaxTempMapper.java
public class MonthMaxTempMapper extends Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
       ^
meanmaxtempreducer.java:5: error: class MeanMaxTempReducer is public, should be declared in a file named MeanMaxTempReducer.java
public class MeanMaxTempReducer extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, DoubleWritable> {
       ^
4 errors
ChatGPT said:
The error messages mean that each public class must be in a file with the exact same name as the class. Here's how to fix it:

‚úÖ Fixing the Error
You need to make sure each public class is saved in its own Java file with the exact same filename as the class name.

Here's what to do:

üìå 1. Correct File and Class Naming
Class Name	Correct File Name
YearTemperatureMapper	YearTemperatureMapper.java
AverageTemperatureReducer	AverageTemperatureReducer.java
MonthMaxTempMapper	MonthMaxTempMapper.java
MeanMaxTempReducer	MeanMaxTempReducer.java

üìù 2. How to Rename and Save Properly
For example:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ncdc/src
mv yeartemperaturemapper.java YearTemperatureMapper.java
mv averagetempreducer.java AverageTemperatureReducer.java
mv monthmaxtempmapper.java MonthMaxTempMapper.java
mv meanmaxtempreducer.java MeanMaxTempReducer.java
Or if you‚Äôre creating the files:

bash
Copy
Edit
gedit YearTemperatureMapper.java
# Paste the YearTemperatureMapper class here, save & close
Repeat for the other 3 files.

‚úÖ 3. Recompile After Fixing
Once the filenames match the class names:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ncdc/src
mkdir -p ~/ncdc/classes
javac -classpath $(hadoop classpath) -d ~/ncdc/classes *.java
No errors should show up this time if filenames and class names are correctly aligned.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to generate a ready-to-use zip of all these Java files!

You said:
cat: /output_year_avg/part-r-00000': No such file or directory
ChatGPT said:
That error means the Hadoop job did not produce output in the directory /output_year_avg ‚Äî likely because:

The job did not run successfully.

The output directory was not created due to an error.

The directory already existed from a previous failed run and Hadoop refused to overwrite it.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step to Resolve This
üîç 1. Check Job Status
Check if the job actually ran and completed:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop fs -ls /output_year_avg
If you get No such file or directory, then the job didn‚Äôt write anything.

If the directory exists but is empty or contains an error log, check the logs.

üßπ 2. Delete any existing output directory before re-running
Hadoop does not allow overwriting an existing output directory. So run:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -rm -r /output_year_avg
Now re-run your job:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar ~/ncdc/ncdc-temp.jar YearTemperatureMapper AverageTemperatureReducer /ncdc /output_year_avg
üîÑ 3. Check again for output
bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /output_year_avg
If part-r-00000 is listed, now you can see the result:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
üîç 4. Still Not Working? Check Logs
Run this to see job logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn logs -applicationId <your-application-id>
Or use:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop job -list
hadoop job -status <job-id>
Let me know if you want help interpreting the logs ‚Äî just paste them here.

Would you like to try this using Python MapReduce (Hadoop Streaming) or Apache Spark instead for easier development and testing?

You said:
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000 when i run this i get hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the update ‚Äî but what you wrote appears to be just repeating the command itself:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
If that's all that appeared in the terminal with no output or error message, here‚Äôs how to proceed:

‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Troubleshoot Step-by-Step
1. üìÅ Did the output file get created?
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /output_year_avg
You should see something like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Found 1 items
-rw-r--r--   1 youruser supergroup       123 2025-05-24 17:35 /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
If part-r-00000 is missing, the job failed.

If it's there but size is 0 bytes, then your MapReduce job produced no output.

2. üìÑ See what‚Äôs in the file (if anything)
If the file exists and is not empty:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
You should see results like:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
1901	23.4
1902	24.1
...
If you see nothing, the file might be empty ‚Äî or your mapper/reducer didn‚Äôt emit any output.

3. üõ†Ô∏è Common Causes of No Output
Cause	How to Check
Data parsing logic is incorrect	Open the raw sample.txt and check what is at columns 15‚Äì19 and 87‚Äì92.
Temperature is invalid	Maybe temperature values are missing (`+999

You said:
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
cat: /output_year_avg/part-r-00000': No such file or directory
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for confirming. Since the output file still doesn't exist, your MapReduce job did not produce any output. Let‚Äôs fix that step by step.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix
üîç 1. Check if output directory exists
Run this:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /
Do you see /output_year_avg in the list?

‚ùå If not listed: The job never ran or failed.

‚úÖ If it is listed, check inside:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /output_year_avg
Let me know what you see.

üßπ 2. Delete output directory if it exists
If /output_year_avg exists (even empty), you must delete it before re-running the job:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -rm -r /output_year_avg
üöÄ 3. Re-run the job carefully
Make sure to run the correct jar with correct class names.

Assuming you used:

YearTemperatureMapper.java

AverageTemperatureReducer.java

Packaged into ncdc-temp.jar

Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar ~/ncdc/ncdc-temp.jar YearTemperatureMapper AverageTemperatureReducer /ncdc /output_year_avg
üìå Make sure:

Your input file is actually present in /ncdc on HDFS. Check with:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /ncdc
You should see something like sample.txt.

üëÅÔ∏è 4. Inspect the input file
If nothing worked so far, your code may be skipping lines due to incorrect assumptions about data format.

Check the first few lines of the sample data:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /ncdc/sample.txt | head -n 5
You're assuming:

java
Copy
Edit
String year = line.substring(15, 19);        // YYYY
String temp = line.substring(87, 92).trim(); // Temperature
Check if:

The string is long enough

Temperature is not +9999, which means "missing"

Characters are actually numeric

‚úÖ Optional Debug: Print mapper output locally
You can run the mapper manually to see if it emits anything:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /ncdc/sample.txt | java -cp ~/ncdc/classes YearTemperatureMapper
But for that, you‚Äôll need a main() function or a test driver. Let me know if you'd like one.

Would you like me to:

üìÅ Generate a working sample dataset tailored to this?

üêç Show how to do this in Hadoop Streaming with Python instead (easier to debug)?

Let‚Äôs get it working!

You said:
is there any other way to view the putput
ChatGPT said:
Yes! If hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000 isn't working (because the file doesn‚Äôt exist), there are several other ways to view or debug the output or issue. Here‚Äôs what you can do:

‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO VIEW OUTPUT OR DEBUG
1. üß≠ Check if the output directory was created
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /output_year_avg
If you see something like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
No such file or directory
‚Üí Your MapReduce job did not run successfully.

2. ü™µ View job logs on the terminal (YARN)
List recent jobs:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn application -list
Copy the Application ID (like application_1682138888888_0001), then:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn logs -applicationId <your-app-id>
üîç Look for lines mentioning:

Exception

ERROR

Killed

java.lang...

3. üñ•Ô∏è Open the Hadoop Web UI (Resource Manager)
If you're using Hadoop with a web interface, you can check the job logs visually:

Go to http://localhost:8088/ (or your cluster's ResourceManager IP/port).

Click on your application/job.

Click Logs and check:

Mapper logs

Reducer logs

Errors and Output

4. üîÑ Try copying output (if it exists) to local file system
If output does exist but cat isn't working (due to terminal issues):

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -get /output_year_avg/part-r-00000 ~/output.txt
cat ~/output.txt
5. üß™ Run a simpler test job on small input
Create a mini text file to test output easily:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "202301011200  123 +0045 ..." > test.txt
hdfs dfs -put test.txt /testinput
Then re-run MapReduce on this smaller input to quickly validate output logic.

6. üì¶ Use hadoop fs instead of hdfs dfs
This is just a different command interface:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop fs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
Both work the same way but use whichever responds.

Would you like me to write a MapReduce test driver (main class) so you can test everything locally without HDFS before running it on Hadoop? It's great for debugging!

You said:
what should be the output
ChatGPT said:
Great question!

The expected output of your MapReduce job to compute the average temperature per year from the NCDC dataset should be a list like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
1901    23.4
1902    24.1
1903    22.9
...
üìä Output Format:
Each line will be:

php-template
Copy
Edit
<year>    <average_temperature>
<year>: extracted from characters 15 to 18 of each record (based on NCDC fixed-width format).

<average_temperature>: the mean temperature for all valid records in that year.

Temperatures are usually recorded in tenths of degrees Celsius, so they must be divided by 10.

Invalid values (like +9999) should be excluded.

üß™ Example (Assuming these input records):
Copy
Edit
0029029070999991901010118004+64333+023450FM-12+0382
0029029070999991901010118004+64333+023450FM-12+9999
0029029070999991902010118004+64333+023450FM-12+0150
These might produce output like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
1901    6.4
1902    15.0
Explanation:

1901 had one valid reading of +0643 ‚Üí 64.3¬∞C

1901 also had one invalid (+9999) ‚Üí skipped

1902 had one reading of +0150 ‚Üí 15.0¬∞C

üìù For Mean Max Temperature by Month:
If you're running the second job (mean max temp per month), output will look like:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
01    25.2
02    28.1
03    33.0
...
Where 01 means January, and the value is the mean of maximum daily temperatures in that month across years.

If your output file is empty or missing, likely causes:

You‚Äôre filtering out all records (e.g., due to invalid temperature codes).

Your input data isn‚Äôt in the expected fixed-width format.

The parsing logic isn‚Äôt matching the dataset structure.

Let me know if you want me to:

Review your mapper/reducer code

Help you generate a small test dataset

Run this using Python for faster debugging

Just say the word!

You said:
like where should the output be
ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs clarify exactly where the output goes when you run a Hadoop MapReduce job.

‚úÖ Where the Output Goes
When you run your Hadoop job like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar ncdc-temp.jar YearTemperatureMapper AverageTemperatureReducer /ncdc /output_year_avg
/ncdc is your input directory on HDFS

/output_year_avg is your output directory on HDFS

So the output will be saved inside /output_year_avg on HDFS, not your local machine.

üìÅ Expected File
If the job runs successfully, HDFS will create:

bash
Copy
Edit
/output_year_avg/part-r-00000
This file contains your final output.

üì• How to View the Output
Use this to display it on your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
OR copy it to your local system:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -get /output_year_avg/part-r-00000 ~/output_year_avg.txt
cat ~/output_year_avg.txt
‚ùóÔ∏èImportant Notes
Hadoop does not overwrite output directories. You must delete them first if they already exist:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -rm -r /output_year_avg
Make sure your input folder /ncdc contains at least one valid file (like sample.txt or 1902.gz).

üîç To See Where Your File Lives:
You can list all files on HDFS:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /output_year_avg
If you see something like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
-rw-r--r--   1 youruser supergroup  248  2025-05-24 12:34 /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
Your output is there ‚úÖ

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to verify your code logic or test it on a small sample locally before running Hadoop.

will the output be seen on a text file saved in the system
ChatGPT said:
Great question! By default, the output of a Hadoop MapReduce job is saved on HDFS, not directly as a file on your local system.

So:
The job output goes into the HDFS output directory you specify (like /output_year_avg).

Inside that directory, you get one or more part files (e.g., part-r-00000) containing the results in plain text.

This output is not automatically saved as a file on your local computer‚Äôs filesystem.

How to get output as a local text file on your system?
You need to copy or download it from HDFS to your local machine explicitly, using:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -get /output_year_avg/part-r-00000 ~/output_year_avg.txt
This will save the output as output_year_avg.txt in your home folder on your local computer.

You can then open and view that file using any text editor.

Summary:
Location	Where Output Lives	How to View
HDFS (default)	/output_year_avg/part-r-00000 (on Hadoop FS)	hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
Local system	After hdfs dfs -get command copies it locally	Open with cat, gedit, vim etc.

If you want, I can help you with a step-by-step guide to:

Download the output from HDFS

View it locally

Just let me know!

i cant run the commands just tell how to print the results on the screen

Got it! You want to print the output directly on your screen after running your Hadoop MapReduce job, without needing to copy files manually.

How to print the MapReduce job output on the screen:
After the job finishes successfully, run this command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
This command prints the contents of the output file directly on your terminal screen.

What if you get errors like "No such file or directory"?
That means the output file /output_year_avg/part-r-00000 does not exist yet.

Make sure your job completed successfully.

Also make sure you are using the correct output directory path.

Quick checklist:
Run your job:

bash
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar yourjar.jar YourMainClass input_dir output_dir
Check if output directory exists:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -ls /output_dir
If it exists, print output:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_dir/part-r-00000
If you just want to print mapper output on the screen while debugging, you can test your Mapper locally by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /input_dir/inputfile | java -cp classes YourMapperClass
(but this requires some coding to add a main() method in the Mapper).

TL;DR:
To print final output on screen after job finishes:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
If this still doesn‚Äôt work, it probably means the job hasn‚Äôt produced output yet. Let me know if you want help fixing that!

The output of your MapReduce job‚Äîfinding the average temperature for each year from the NCDC dataset‚Äîwill be lines like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
1901    23.4
1902    24.1
1903    22.9
...
Each line consists of:

Year (e.g., 1901, 1902, ...)

A tab or space separator

The average temperature for that year, usually in degrees Celsius (or tenths of degrees if you haven‚Äôt converted)

What this means:
For each year, the program calculates the mean temperature based on all valid daily temperature records.

Invalid or missing temperature readings are skipped.

Temperature values are often stored as integers representing tenths of degrees, so your reducer typically divides by 10 to get the actual Celsius value.

Example output snippet:
yaml

1901    23.4
1902    24.1
1903    22.9

Edit
1901    23.4

...
directly in the terminal, after your Hadoop job completes, use this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /output_year_avg/part-r-00000
Explanation:
This reads the Hadoop output file (part-r-00000) from the HDFS output directory /output_year_avg.

It prints the file contents (your year and average temperature pairs) straight to your terminal screen.

If you want to test printing that exact output manually on your terminal without Hadoop (just as a simple text):
Run this command to print those lines exactly:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo -e "1901\t23.4\n1902\t24.1\n1903\t22.9"
This will print:

yaml
Copy
Edit
1901    23.4
1902    24.1
1903    22.9
If your Hadoop job output file exists on HDFS, the hdfs dfs -cat command is what you want.

If you want, I can guide you through any step!
